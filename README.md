# Chatapp

I developed a simple chat application using Flutter and Firebase technologies. The app uses Firebase Authentication to securely authenticate users and Firestore to store and retrieve chat messages in real-time. The code is written in Flutter, a popular cross-platform mobile development framework, making the application available on both Android and iOS platforms. This project showcases my skills in mobile app development and proficiency in working with Firebase services.
